# personalFinance
An experimental repository to play around with a budgeting software app

## What is this?

This is the beginning of a personal finance app that I'm building. It is a simple cloud based budgeting tool that I will use to track my expenses and income.

It will also be a project for me to learn more about python, cloud development, and AI

## How will I do this

First, I will create a database that will store all of my expenses and income. I will use a relational database to store the data. I will also use a cloud database to store the data.

Next, I will create a script that allows me to extract data from a pdf, such as a bank statement, and store it in the database.

I will then use an AI model to predict the category of each expense.
